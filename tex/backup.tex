\begin{itemize}
\item how do genetic regulatory networks evolved with direct plasticity differ structurally from control networks?
\item impact of other modes of direct plasticity on evolvability (rule noise, fixed states, intermediate state perturbation)?
\item impact of indirect plasticity on evolvability?
\item combined impact of direct and indirect plasticity on evolvability?
\end{itemize}
